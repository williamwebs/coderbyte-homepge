This is more like a ReadMe file for what this project is all all about.

Its just a simple one-page website containing a header section which houses the header text,
a section and an aside content containing the nav items, and lastly a footer all enclosed in
a container div.


A breakdown of what is required.
    1. a container div
        2. a header div
            3. an h1 element containing the heading text and maybe logo
        4. a content div

            6. a secton / main section div containing some dummy texts
        7. a footer cotaining some copyright texts and address.
